        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gameplay data:</strong> The App stores progress (coins, XP, themes/unlocks, achievements) on your device and may sync it using Apple CloudKit.</li>
          <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> The App may show ads using Google AdMob (including rewarded ads and native ads). Ad providers may collect device/usage data.</li>
          <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> The App offers in-app purchases (e.g., “No Ads in Home”) through Apple’s App Store. The App does not store your payment details.</li>

        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1) Information you provide</h3>
        <p>
          The App does not require you to submit personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number to use core features.
          If you contact us for support, you may provide information in your message (such as an email address).
        </p>

        <h3>2) Information collected automatically</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on configuration and usage, the App and third-party services may collect certain information automatically, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>

        <h3>3) Gameplay and progress data</h3>
        <p>
          The App stores gameplay progress locally on your device (for example: coins, XP, rounds completed, unlocked themes, and achievements).
          This data is used to provide gameplay features and restore progress.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>CloudKit Sync (Apple iCloud)</h2>
        <p>
          If you are signed into iCloud on your device and iCloud is available, the App may sync certain gameplay/progress data using
          <strong>Apple CloudKit</strong> (private database under your iCloud account). This is used to help restore your progress across reinstalls/devices.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data synced may include:</strong> coins, XP, themes/unlocks, achievements, and similar progress fields.</li>
          <li><strong>Who can access:</strong> This data is stored in your iCloud private database and is intended to be accessible only to you and Apple’s iCloud services.</li>
          <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can disable iCloud for the App in iOS Settings, which may limit cross-device restoration.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
        <p>
          The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads (including rewarded ads and native ads). AdMob and its partners may collect and process data
          to provide and measure ads, prevent fraud, and improve services.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data AdMob may collect:</strong> device identifiers (as permitted), IP address, approximate location, ad performance, and interaction data.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalized ads:</strong> Depending on your settings and region, ads may be personalized or non-personalized.</li>
          <li><strong>Opt-out controls:</strong> You can adjust ad tracking permissions via iOS settings (e.g., “Allow Apps to Request to Track”).</li>
        </ul>
